### New Zealand GDP Forecast
**Code:** ['New Zealnd GDP Forecast']https://github.com/dandai509/IOD/blob/main/Capstone%20project-%20NZ%20GDP%20Forecasting(Final).ipynb

**Goal:** To predict NZ GDP's future trend by using the ARIMA Model and Linear Regression Model

**Description:** This project foucused on building up machine learning model(Time Series) to forecast GDP rather than a traditional Econometrics model. The source of Data is from World Bank, the data bank. All data are yearly from 1972 to 2021.The project involved data collection, data cleaning, performing EDA, anaylysing time series data by using SARIMA Model and Liner Regression Model.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, Machine learning Modeling, Hyper Parameters tuning, Cross Validation

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Sklearn

**Results:** Both ARIMA and Linear regression models can be used to predict GDP growth, Linear regression model has outperformed ARIMA model with a Smaller RMSE value
