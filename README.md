### New Zealand GDP Forecast
**Code:** ['New Zealand GDP Forecast'](https://github.com/dandai509/IOD/blob/main/Capstone%20project-%20NZ%20GDP%20Forecasting(Final).ipynb)

**Goal:** To predict NZ GDP's future trend by using the ARIMA Model and Linear Regression Model

**Description:** This project focused on building up a machine learning model(Time Series) to forecast GDP rather than a traditional Econometrics model. The source of Data is from World Bank, the data bank. All data are yearly from 1972 to 2021. The project involved data collection, data cleaning, performing EDA, anaylysing time series data by using SARIMA Model and Liner Regression Model.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, Machine learning modeling, Hyper Parameters tuning, Cross Validation

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Sklearn

**Results:** Both ARIMA and Linear regression models can be used to predict GDP growth, Linear regression model has outperformed ARIMA model with a Smaller RMSE value 

### Home Loan Eligibility Prediction
**Code:** ['Home Loan Eligibility Prediction'](https://github.com/dandai509/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Mini%20Project%203%20-%20Home%20Loan%20Prediction.ipynb)

**Goal:** To build a Machine Learning Model to automate the loan eligibility process

**Description:** This project focused on building a machine learning mode that can best predict loan eligibility. Data set from Kaggle, include a variety of factors such as Gender, marriage status, education, employment, total income etc. This project involved data cleaning and preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation of the model. EDA was also performed to demonstrate the results.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, Machine learning Modeling, Correlation, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Model, Random Forrest Model

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn

**Results:** Decision Tree Model has the highest Accuracy of 79% to predict the loan eligibility. Credit History, total income, property area and loan amount being top 4 factors that affect loan approval


### Data Exploration Analysis on Airbnb Amsterdam
**Code:** ['EDA on Airbnb Amsterdam'](https://github.com/dandai509/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Mini%20project.ipynb)

**Goal:** To produce a detailed price analysis report to client and supports clear recommendation for investment

**Description:** This project focused on Data Exploration Analysis for Amsterdam airbnb prices. data scraped from airbnb website. factors such as the revenue of the most successful host/neighborhoods, most reviewed/listed property/neighborhoods are all taken into consideration in the analysis

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, geospatial analysis, correlation analysis


**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

**Results:** Data analysis reported showed top and average Airbnb host revenue report demonstrated, the most popular Airbnb type property found. Most listing and highest revenue area found in Amsterdam. 

### Covid 19 Data Exploration
**Code:** [`COVID 19 SQL Project.sql`](https://github.com/dandai509/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/COVID%2019%20SQL%20Project.sql)
**Goal:** To perform EDA on COVID 19 date to show New Zealand VS World
**Description:** This project focused on Data Exploration Analysis for COVID-19 of different countries from Feb 2020 to April 2021. The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country. Steps includes data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA 

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

**Technology:** SQL Server
