## Power BI Projects

### Univeristy Customer Survey Analysis

**Report:** [`Customer Survey Analysis`](https://github.com/dandai509/PowerBI-University-Customer-Survey-Analysis)

**Goal:** To find out how customers rate our services and seek space for improvement

**Description:** The University of Auckland Recreation Center conducts customer surveys on an annual basis. The goal is to find out how customers rate our services and seek space for improvement. In the 2022 report, various questions were asked, and raw data were gathered from UoA website. As an operations coordinator, I’m responsible for generating a report by using Power BI to the manager to make operational decisions based on the data findings.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data transformation, data modeling, data analysis, data visualization

**Technology:** MS PowerBI, MS Excel, Power Query, DAX, M Language, Pivot table

**Results:** The dashboard provided Rec Centre customer service team with a clear, data-backed understanding of member satisfaction. Several initiatives—such as improved communication and community events—were implemented based on these findings. This work project showcased my ability to turn raw survey data into business insights that drive positive change.

## SQL Projects

### Eden Pizza Sales Analysis

**Report:** [`Pizza Sales Analysis`](https://github.com/dandai509/SQL-Power-BI-Pizza-Sales-Analysis-)

**Goal:** To help the owner of the Pizza store to find out insight about the finicial performance of his business, ncluding Key metrics KPIs. Provide recommendations to the owner for him to make business decisions.

**Description:** This project focused on figuring out key performance indicators such as Total Revenue, Average Pizzas per order, Daily Trend for Total Orders, Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Revenue etc.

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types,data cleaning, data transformation, data modeling, data analysis, data visualization

**Technology:** MS PowerBI, MS Excel, Power Query, DAX, M Language, Pivot table,SQL Server

### Covid 19 Data Exploration

**Code:** [`COVID 19 SQL Project.sql`](https://github.com/dandai509/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/COVID%2019%20SQL%20Project.sql)

**Goal:** To perform EDA on COVID 19 date to show New Zealand VS World

**Description:** This project focused on Data Exploration Analysis for COVID-19 of different countries from Feb 2020 to April 2021. The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country. Steps includes data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA 

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

**Technology:** SQL Server

## Python Projects

### New Zealand GDP Forecast(Time Series Analysis)

**Code:** ['New Zealand GDP Forecast'](https://github.com/dandai509/IOD/blob/main/Capstone%20project-%20NZ%20GDP%20Forecasting(Final).ipynb)

**Goal:** To predict NZ GDP's future trend by using the ARIMA Model and Linear Regression Model

**Description:** This project focused on building up a machine learning model(Time Series) to forecast GDP rather than a traditional Econometrics model. The source of Data is from World Bank, the data bank. All data are yearly from 1972 to 2021. The project involved data collection, data cleaning, performing EDA, anaylysing time series data by using SARIMA Model and Liner Regression Model.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, Machine learning modeling, Hyper Parameters tuning, Cross Validation

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Sklearn

**Results:** Both ARIMA and Linear regression models can be used to predict GDP growth, Linear regression model has outperformed ARIMA model with a Smaller RMSE value 

### Home Loan Eligibility Prediction(Supervised Machine Learning Model)

**Code:** ['Home Loan Eligibility Prediction'](https://github.com/dandai509/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Mini%20Project%203%20-%20Home%20Loan%20Prediction.ipynb)

**Goal:** To build a Machine Learning Model to automate the loan eligibility process

**Description:** This project focused on building a machine learning mode that can best predict loan eligibility. Data set from Kaggle, include a variety of factors such as Gender, marriage status, education, employment, total income etc. This project involved data cleaning and preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation of the model. EDA was also performed to demonstrate the results.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, Machine learning Modeling, Correlation, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Model, Random Forrest Model

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn

**Results:** Decision Tree Model has the highest Accuracy of 79% to predict the loan eligibility. Credit History, total income, property area and loan amount being top 4 factors that affect loan approval


### Data Exploration Analysis on Airbnb Amsterdam(EDA)
**Code:** ['EDA on Airbnb Amsterdam'](https://github.com/dandai509/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Mini%20project.ipynb)

**Goal:** To produce a detailed price analysis report to client and supports clear recommendation for investment

**Description:** This project focused on Data Exploration Analysis for Amsterdam airbnb prices. data scraped from airbnb website. factors such as the revenue of the most successful host/neighborhoods, most reviewed/listed property/neighborhoods are all taken into consideration in the analysis

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, geospatial analysis, correlation analysis

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

**Results:** Data analysis reported showed top and average Airbnb host revenue report demonstrated, the most popular Airbnb type property found. Most listing and highest revenue area found in Amsterdam.
